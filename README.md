The problem addressed in this analysis is customer churn management in the service industry, 
specifically using customer data from a bank. The analysis combines churn prediction and 
customer segmentation to create an integrated customer analytics outline. The six 
components of the analysis are data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, customer 
segmentation using K-means clustering, customer characteristics analytics, churn prediction 
using machine learning models optimized for precision, and factor analysis using feature 
importance. The goal is to accurately identify and label different groups of customers based 
on their characteristics and predict churn with high precision.
